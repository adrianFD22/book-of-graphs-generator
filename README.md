# Book of graphs

A Sage script for finding graphs satisfying a given property and displaying them in a pdf file by generating and compiling a latex file . It uses [nauty-geng](https://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/) through the Sage interface for generating graphs and compiles the latex file with pdflatex. The script is short so both can be replaced.
